            <p>In my community and many others, financial literacy has never been considered a requirement. Grades K-12 cover a decent variety of topics over time and somehow one you never have to question whether you will use in real life or not just never makes it to curriculums. Financial Literacy for Future Achievers would love to see a personal finance requirement become a reality but until then, we will push this information to as many as we can. Our target audience is middle and high school aged students with a preference for seniority. The older the student, the more we want to have an impact before they start possibly taking on adult responsibilities. See our contact page and don't hesitate to reach out with any comments or questions.  </p>
            <h3>It does not have to be a secret or a foreign language</h3>
            <p>The knowledge is there for you and anyone else that wants to learn. It's not an exclusive club for high
                IQs and big bank accounts only. It's a simple life skill! </p>

            <h3>You do not have to wait until you're going through a crisis</h3>
            <p>Many people will not be inspired until there is a financial crisis that forces them to take action and
                educate themselves. Others will wait until personal financial issues hit them to take action. We are
                here to
                make sure you step into the next phase of your life prepared, before your first crisis, negotation,
                loan,
                etc. Start while your slate is clean. </p>
